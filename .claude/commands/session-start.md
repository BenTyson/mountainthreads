# Session Start

Read the following files to get up to speed on the Mountain Threads project:

1. First, read `docs/session-start/README.md` for quick context
2. Then read `docs/session-start/CURRENT_STATUS.md` for what's done and what's next
3. Check `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` for the master task checklist
4. Optionally read the latest session log in `docs/sessions/` for recent work details

After reading, provide a brief summary of:
- Current project status
- What was completed in the last session
- What tasks are next in the queue
- Any blockers or notes to be aware of

Keep your response concise and focused on actionable next steps.
